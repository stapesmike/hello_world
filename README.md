Hi All,

I'm Mike. Just a guy that has been programming for some time (38 years).
State of the art stuff like COBOL (haha). Don't laugh, it has made me a
lot of money. I've gone through many languages in my career but none have
been able to migrate as easy as COBOL.

I have used HTML, PHP, NUSOAP, and backend interfaces to make legacy systems work.

I am looking forward to making a leap into all the latest and greatest languages, IDEs
and whatever is needed to continue programming.

I am interested in AI but have no idea where to start in being trained to write AI applications.

Have a good one.

Mike
